Analysis of completed purchases, cohort analysis and RMF - user segmentation

1. How many users who made a purchase only once?
2. How many orders per month, on average, are not delivered for various reasons (display details by reasons)?
3. For each product, it was determined on which day of the week the product is most often bought.
4. How many purchases does each user make on average per week (by months)? 
5. Using pandas, conducted a cohort analysis of users. In the period from January to December, I identified the cohort with the highest retention for the 3rd month.
6. I built RFM user segmentation in order to qualitatively evaluate my audience. In clustering, I chose the following metrics: R - time from the last purchase of the user to the current date, F - the total number of purchases from the user for the entire time, M - the amount of purchases for the entire time.
